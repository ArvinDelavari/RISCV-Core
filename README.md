# RISCV-Core
RISC-V CPU Design using TL-Verilog in Makerchip IDE :

- Design of a simple 32-bit RISC-V CPU using the base instruction set, RV32I (+5 stage pipeline).
- Hardware description was done with TL-Verilog(Transaction Level Verilog)  using Makerchip IDE, which gives a better sense of timing abstraction.
- You can simulate this RISC-V processors on Linux using GCC Compiler toolchain and iVerilog tool, using Verilog output of Makerchip IDE.
- Updates and new features will be added to the CPU; this file is a simple base microprocessor.
